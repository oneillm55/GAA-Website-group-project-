<h3>Gaelic football</h3>

<b>Staunton</b> began playing Gaelic football at the age of seven in her local school in Carnacon.

She made her first appearance in an All-Ireland final in 1999.
However, she played just 90 seconds of the game because she had broken her collarbone in training a week before the final.
The team elected to start her anyway, as a ceremonial gesture.
She made her second All-Ireland appearance in 2000, scoring 2:2 as Mayo defeated Waterford.
Staunton's third All-Ireland appearance in 2001 ended in disappointment after a mix-up over a last minute kick-out saw Mayo lose by a single point to Laois.

<h3>Association Football</h3>
<p>
<b>Staunton</b> plays association football for Ballyglass Ladies in the Mayo Ladies League.
As a youth she was invited to trials for the Republic of Ireland U–16s but she declined, preferring to concentrate on Gaelic football.
However, she continued to play association football at club level.
In 2006, she was a member of the Mayo Ladies League representative team that won the FAI Women's Cup, defeating UCD 1–0 in the final at Richmond Park.
Staunton was just one of several members of the Mayo Ladies League representative team who also played Ladies Gaelic football for Mayo.
Others included Yvonne Byrne, Aoife Herbert, Michelle Ruane, Martha Carter, Triona McNicholas and Emma Mullin.
As a result of winning the 2006 FAI Women's Cup, the Mayo Ladies League qualified to represent the Republic of Ireland in the 2007–08 UEFA Women's Cup.
The competition format saw the team travel to Austria in August 2007 to play in a mini-tournament to decide who would progress to the next round.
Unfortunately the UEFA Women's Cup tournament clashed with a 2007 All-Ireland Senior Ladies' Football Championship quarter-final game against Monaghan.
In the opening game of the tournament, Staunton scored for Mayo in a 4–1 defeat to Gol Częstochowa.
However, she then returned to Ireland, along with Yvonne Byrne and Aoife Herbert, to line-up against Monaghan.
While playing with Ballyglass Ladies, Staunton also won the 2011 WFAI Intermediate Cup
