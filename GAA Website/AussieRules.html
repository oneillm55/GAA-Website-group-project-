<p> <h4>Backround</h4>


 <a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Rules_Series">The International Rules Series</a> is a senior men's international rules football competition between the Australia international rules football team
 (selected by the Australian Football League) and the Ireland international rules football team (selected by the Gaelic Athletic Association).
 The series is played close to annually in October or November,
 after the completion of the AFL Grand Final and the All-Ireland Football Final which are both traditionally played in late September
  The matches are played using a set of compromise rules decided upon by both the two governing bodies; known formally as international rules football.
  While the International Rules Series matches use some rules from Australian rules football, 
  the field, ball and uniforms of both teams are all from Gaelic football.

The two teams contest a trophy, which in 2004 was named the Cormac McAnallen Cupâ€”after the Tyrone team captain Cormac McAnallen,
 whose death that year from a heart condition came after he had represented Ireland in the previous three series.

<p> <h4>RULES</h4>

The rules are designed to provide a compromise or combine between those of the two codes,
 with Gaelic football players being advantaged by the use of a round ball and a rectangular field measured about 160 yards long by 98 yards wide
 (Australian rules uses an oval ball and field),
 while the Australian rules football players benefit from the opportunity to tackle by grabbing between the shoulders and thighs and pulling to the ground,
 something banned in Gaelic football. The game also introduces the concept of the mark, 
from Australian rules football, with a free kick awarded for a ball caught from a kick of over 15 metres, where the kick must be in the forward direction if originating from a teammate.
