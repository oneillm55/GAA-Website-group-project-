It was with divisional side West Kerry that Ó Sé enjoyed his greatest success.

In late 1995 Páidí Ó Sé was appointed manager of Kerry’s senior football side.
Football in the county was at an all-time low.
The Kingdom hadn’t won an All-Ireland title since 1986 and their last provincial title was won in 1991.
There was tremendous pressure on Páidí Ó Sé, however, he delivered three Munster title in his three years in charge.
In 1997 Páidí Ó Sé guided Kerry to a National League title, before finally clinching a long-awaited All-Ireland title later that same year.
Three more Munster titles followed over the next few years, as well as a second All-Ireland title in 2000.
Kerry’s fortunes took a downturn following this victory.
Páidí Ó Sé's side were defeated by Armagh in the All-Ireland final of 2002.
Kerry then lost to Tyrone in the 2003 All-Ireland semi-final in what was described as a “disastrous defeat”.
Páidí Ó Sé. Páidí Ó Sé remained involved in management in 2004, this time taking charge of Westmeath,
a side not noted for success. Páidí Ó Sé proved to be an inspired choice as manager as he led them to their first Leinster Championship title ever.
His second season in charge of Westmeath was less successful and he resigned after one term in charge and was replaced by his understudy Tomás O’Flatharta.
In 2006 he was linked with a possible return to Kerry as manager, however,
instead he was appointed manager of the Clare senior footballers.
He resigned in July 2007 after Clare was defeated by Antrim in the semi–finals of the Tommy Murphy Cup.
