<h3>Early years</h3>
<p>Shefflin was born at the Regional Hospital Waterford to Henry and Mae Shefflin (née Fitzgerald). One of a family of four boys and three girls,
he was born into a household that had a strong sporting background, particularly in the game of hurling.
Shefflin was educated at St. Patrick's national school in Ballyhale where his hurling skills were first noted and honed by the local headmaster, Joe Dunphy.
As a child he saw his two older brothers line out with the Kilkenny hurlers at various grades. John Shefflin won an All-Ireland winners' medal in the minor grade in 1990,
while Tommy Shefflin won an All-Ireland winners' medal in the under-21 grade that same year.
A younger brother, Paul Shefflin, also won Leinster minor medals in the late 1990s.
Shefflin later attended St.
Kieran's College in Kilkenny, before studying electronics at the Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT).
Shefflin later changed course and decided to study both business studies and financial services. 
</p>
<h3>Personal life</h3>
<p>Shefflin currently works with New Holland Finance, a subsidiary of Bank of Ireland.
His main area of responsibility is in the agri-business side of matters, handling the finance for all the New Holland tractor sales in the locality.
His region of responsibility takes in the south-east of the country, including Tipperary, Kilkenny, Wexford, Carlow and Kildare.
On 30 March 2007 Shefflin married Deirdre O'Sullivan,a native of Callan,
County Kilkenny and a camogie player of note in her own right.Just over a year later in April 2008 the Shefflins celebrated the birth of their first child, a daughter named Sadhbh.
On 30 October 2009 Henry Michael Shefflin, the couple's second child and first son, was born. A third child, Siún, was born in March 2011,
,while the Shefflin's youngest boy, Freddie, was born in April 2014.</p>

<h3>Colleges</h3>
<p>During his schooling at St. Kieran's College in Kilkenny, Shefflin established himself as a key member of the senior hurling team.
In 1996 he won his sole Leinster medal as Good Counsel College were narrowly defeated by 1-7 to 1-6. St.
Colman's College provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland decider. A 1-14 to 2-6 victory gave Shefflin an All-Ireland medal.
</p>
<h3>University</h3>
<p>During his studies at the Waterford Institute of Technology, Shefflin was an automatic inclusion on the college hurling team. In 1999 he was at full-forward as WIT faced University College Cork in the final of the Fitzgibbon Cup.
Two goals from Declan Browne in a six-minute spell before half-time gave WIT a commanding lead.
Neil Ronan bagged a fourth goal straight after the interval which helped WIT to a 4-15 to 3-12 victory.
Shefflin lined out in a second successive Fitzgibbon Cup decider in 2000.
University College Dublin were the opponents on that occasion, however, a 2-10 to 1-6 victory gave WIT the victory.
It was Shefflin's second Fitzgibbon Cup medal.
</p>
<h3>Club</h3>
<p>Shefflin plays his club hurling with Ballyhale Shamrocks and has had much success with the club.
When he was fourteen years-old he failed to make the club's under-16 team, however,
Shefflin later became a key member of the Ballyhale minor team.
He won a championship medal in that grade in 1997.
That same year Shefflin was a key member of the Ballyhale intermediate team.
With Shefflin top scoring,
secured promotion to the senior grade and gave Shefflin a championship medal.</p>
<p>Success at senior level was slow in coming for Shefflin and Ballyhale.
In 2004 it was even rumoured that he was moving clubs to play in Cork with Blackrock, however,
this rumour proved to be unfounded.
Five-in-a-row proved beyond Ballyhale Shamrocks, however,
the team bounced back in 2012 having lost the championship decider the previous year.
A far from vintage 0-16 to 0-12 defeat of Dicksboro gave Shefflin a fourth championship medal.
